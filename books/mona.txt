The Story of Mona

Once upon a time, there was a cat whoâ€™s name was Monalisa.

Monalisa and her owner went to the beach. When Monalisa got to the beach, her owner Kelly gave her goggles so Monalisa could swim and see what was in the ocean.

When Monalisa went in the water she found lots of fish. When Monalisa was swimming she was so exited she opened her mouth and swouloed a coral that made you grow legs like a octapus but keep your normal face.

So Monalisa grew legs and became Mrs. Monalisa Octocat.
